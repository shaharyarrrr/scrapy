2/12/2015,"Care Medicentre,, Kingsway Camp, Delhi",13:43:25,Dr. Arpana Jain,"It has been very difficult to find a gynaecologist who cares and listens patiently about my problems and needs. My previous experiences with some gynae doctors were not pleasant which I don't even want to remember! So this time, I was very careful while choosing which Doctor to visit and i was sure that she would understand me when I saw her profile and the reviews sure did really helped me in finding the right Doctor. She was very professional and careful. Thank you so much Doctor. Looking forward to make you my future Gynaecologist. And those of you who are reading this review and is confused of whom to go to, stop scrolling and just go for her. I am sure your experience will  be very pleasant too. I am not someone who writes reviews so this is my 1st review ever and i was convinced to write it as i am convinced that there may be more people like me out there who are confused. Hope this helps. Sorry for the long review though!", Verified Patient
